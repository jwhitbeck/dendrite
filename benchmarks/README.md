# Dendrite benchmark code

A write-up of the latest benchmark results is available on the dendrite [project page](FIXME).

To run the benchmarks, just check out the dendrite project on a test box and run the followings commands.

    cd benchmarks
    lein run

Allow a few hours for the benchmarks to run. The results will be the `output` directory. A few options are
available. Run `lein run --help` for details.

Past raw results and plots for older builds of dendrite are available under the
[results](benchmarks/results) folder.
