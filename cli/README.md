# Dendrite cli tool

A command-line tool for interacting with dendrite files.

Clojure is a particularly bad fit for CLI tools given its slow startup times. This code was only used for demo
purposes in combination with [drip](https://github.com/ninjudd/drip), and will be replaced with a proper CLI
tool in the future.
